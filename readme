Reasonable Password Policy Example
	password_hash(base64_encode(hash('sha256', $_POST['password'], true)),PASSWORD_DEFAULT)
	Passwords must be at between 12 and 4,096 characters in length.
	Passwords can contain any characters (including Unicode).
	We strongly encourage the use of a password manager like KeePass or KeePassX to generate and store your passwords.

Persistent Authentication Tokens
	just generate a unique token when a user checks the "Remember Me" box 
	store the unique token in a cookie
	have a database table that associates tokens with each user's account 

Account Recovery
	having access to a user's email account or cell phone grants an attacker into every application or service they have an account with.
	Allow your users to attach a GnuPG public key to their profile. When an account recovery request is issued for their account, encrypt the account recovery token with their 
	public key so only someone in possession of their private key can access it.

Login
	-> Synchronizer token
	-> session_id
	-> JWT token
	-> OAUTH2 token
